# Press Against Humanity (working title)

(Considering title: Type Against Humanity)

## Overview

This is just a web-based version of Cards Against Humanity.

## Code

There is a server-side and there is a very thin client-side.

### Client/Server??

The server is supposed to be a stand-alone service that communicates using SocketIO.  The client will only be a sample of how to communicate with this application.
Ideally, there supposed to be many different clients that connect to the service.  React-Native and perhaps others.  This separation will hopefully promote a cleaner separation.
